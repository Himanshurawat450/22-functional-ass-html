    <b>Q1. Create an arrow function called square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. Use
        the arrow function to calculate the square of a given number and display the result.</b>
        <p>
            Here's how you can create an arrow function called square to calculate the square of a given number and display the result:</p>
            <pre>
                // Arrow function to calculate square
const square = (number) => number * number;

// Example usage
const numberToSquare = 5;
console.log(`The square of ${numberToSquare} is: ${square(numberToSquare)}`);

            </pre>
            <p>This code defines an arrow function square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. Then, it demonstrates how to use this function to calculate the square of a given number (in this case, 5) and display the result using console.log().</p>
            <b>Q2. Create a JavaScript function called generateGreeting that takes a name as an argument and returns a
                personalized greeting message. Use this function to greet three different people.</b>
                <p>
                    Here's how you can create a JavaScript function called generateGreeting to generate personalized greeting messages for different people:
                    
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        // Function to generate personalized greeting
function generateGreeting(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our website.`;
}

// Greeting three different people
const person1 = "Alice";
const person2 = "Bob";
const person3 = "Charlie";

console.log(generateGreeting(person1));
console.log(generateGreeting(person2));
console.log(generateGreeting(person3));

                    </pre>
                    <p>This code defines a function generateGreeting that takes a name as an argument and returns a personalized greeting message. Then, it demonstrates how to use this function to greet three different people (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) by passing their names to the function and logging the returned greeting messages to the console using console.log()</p>
                   <b>Q3. Create an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that calculates the square of a number and
                    immediately displays the result.</b> 
                    <p>
                        Here's how you can create an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to calculate the square of a number and immediately display the result:</p>
                
 <pre>
    (function() {
        // Define the number
        const number = 5;
    
        // Calculate the square
        const square = number * number;
    
        // Display the result
        console.log(`The square of ${number} is: ${square}`);
    })();
 </pre>
 <b>Q4. Write a JavaScript function called calculateTax that takes an income as an argument and returns the
    amount of tax to be paid. Use a closure to handle different tax rates based on income ranges. Test the
    function with various incomes.</b>
    <p>To achieve this, you can create a JavaScript function called calculateTax that takes an income as an argument and returns the amount of tax to be paid. This function will utilize a closure to handle different tax rates based on income ranges. Here's how you can implement it:</p>
    <pre>
        function calculateTax() {
            // Define tax rates based on income ranges using closure
            function getTaxRate(income) {
                if (income <= 10000) {
                    return 0.05; // 5% tax rate
                } else if (income <= 50000) {
                    return 0.1; // 10% tax rate
                } else {
                    return 0.15; // 15% tax rate
                }
            }
        
            // Main function to calculate tax
            return function(income) {
                const taxRate = getTaxRate(income);
                return income * taxRate;
            };
        }
        
        // Test the function with various incomes
        const calculateTaxForIncome = calculateTax();
        
        const income1 = 8000;
        console.log(`Tax to be paid for income $${income1}: $${calculateTaxForIncome(income1)}`);
        
        const income2 = 30000;
        console.log(`Tax to be paid for income $${income2}: $${calculateTaxForIncome(income2)}`);
        
        const income3 = 70000;
        console.log(`Tax to be paid for income $${income3}: $${calculateTaxForIncome(income3)}`);
    </pre>
    <pre>
        The calculateTax function returns another function that calculates the tax based on the income provided. This inner function has access to the getTaxRate function, which determines the tax rate based on the income range.
The getTaxRate function is defined inside calculateTax and uses closure to capture and retain access to its enclosing scope.
The outer function calculateTax returns the inner function, which can then be used to calculate tax for different incomes.
Finally, we test the function with various incomes by calling calculateTaxForIncome with different income values and logging the result.

    <b>Q5. Write a JavaScript function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using
        recursion. Test the function with different inputs.</b>
        <p>
            To calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion in JavaScript, you can create a function called factorial. Here's how you can implement it:</p>
            <pre>function factorial(n) {
                // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
                if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
                    return 1;
                }
                // Recursive case: factorial of n is n multiplied by factorial of (n-1)
                return n * factorial(n - 1);
            }
            
            // Test the function with different inputs
            console.log("Factorial of 0:", factorial(0)); // Output: 1
            console.log("Factorial of 1:", factorial(1)); // Output: 1
            console.log("Factorial of 5:", factorial(5)); // Output: 120
            console.log("Factorial of 10:", factorial(10)); // Output: 3628800</pre>
            <p>In this code:

                The factorial function takes a non-negative integer n as input.
                If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1, so the function returns 1.
                For values of n greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with n - 1 and multiplies the result by n.
                This process continues until the base case is reached, and then the results are multiplied together to calculate the factorial.
                Finally, the function is tested with different inputs using console.log.
                
                
                
                </p>
                <b>Q6. Write a JavaScript function called curry that takes a function as an argument and returns a curried
                    version of that function. The curried function should accept arguments one at a time and return a new
                    function until all arguments are provided. Then, it should execute the original function with all arguments.
                    Test the curry function with a function that adds two numbers.</b>
                    <pre>
                        function curry(func) {
                            return function curried(...args) {
                                if (args.length >= func.length) {
                                    return func(...args);
                                } else {
                                    return function(...newArgs) {
                                        return curried(...args.concat(newArgs));
                                    };
                                }
                            };
                        }
                        
                        // Test the curry function with a function that adds two numbers
                        function add(x, y) {
                            return x + y;
                        }
                        
                        const curriedAdd = curry(add);
                        
                        console.log(curriedAdd(5)(3)); // Output: 8
                        console.log(curriedAdd(5, 3)); // Output: 8
                        console.log(curriedAdd(5)(3, 2)); // Output: 8
                        console.log(curriedAdd(5)(3)(2)); // Output: 10
                    </pre>
                    <p>In this code:

                        The curry function takes a function func as an argument.
                        It returns another function curried that collects arguments until it has received the expected number of arguments for the original function func.
                        Once all arguments are provided, it calls the original function func with those arguments.
                        The curry function utilizes closures to retain access to the func and args variables.
                        We test the curry function with a simple add function that adds two numbers, creating a curried version of it (curriedAdd). We then demonstrate different ways of calling the curried function with various argument combinations.</p>
